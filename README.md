# Family Gathering

# Overview

Weekly meal planning can be a huge obstacle for busy families. Trying to juggle meal ideas, variety, satisfying every family member with favorite meals, and more can be a real struggle. This app will help to simplify the process by encouraging families to collaborate on the meal planning process. 

Everyone will be able to suggest the meals that they would like to eat that week, while the parents will be the final decision makers. The final decisions will be able to be added to the calendar, which can be viewed by everyone, so no more, "What are we having for dinner?" 20 minutes before meal time.
